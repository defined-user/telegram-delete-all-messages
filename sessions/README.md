This directory stores all user session files, required for authentication.
In case, if you want to skip initial authentication (entering your phone number
and two-step-verification code), just put your session file into this directory.

If you don't have any session files at this moment, just run the programme once
and you will get prompt to enter these credentials. After you do this, a session
file will appear here automatically.
